    <h1>The secret!</h1>
    <h2>Ozymandias</h2>
    <h3>By Percy Shelley</h3>
    <p>I met a traveller from an antique land,</p>
    <p>Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</p>
    <p>Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,</p>
    <p>Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</p>
    <p>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,</P>
    <p>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</p>
    <p>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</p>
    <p>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;</p>
    <p>And on the pedestal, these words appear:</p>
    <p>My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;</p>
    <p>Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!</p>
    <p>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay</p>
    <p>Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare</p>
    <p>The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</p>
